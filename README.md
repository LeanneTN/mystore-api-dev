## Introduction
MyStore is an online shopping website that build for getting familiar with
the way to build a software with more efficient and actual way. It also becomes
a project for me to write down the notes while I meet something new or meaningful
during the development.

MyStore API is the back-end of the whole project, includes the functions that 
handle the requirement from client-end or management-end that will be 
developed in the following period.

API documents may be released in the future.
